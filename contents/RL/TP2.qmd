# Lab work n°2 

You can download **Lab Work n°2: RL for stochastic control problems** as a Jupyter Notebook [here](TP2-RL/TP%20n%C2%B02-%20RL%20in%20Continuous%20Time.ipynb). All the necessary information is already included in the notebook, but a brief summary of the lab content is provided below for convenience.


## Summary of the lab

<span class="para-title"> Content : </span>

The lab work is divided into 2 parts :
 
- The first part is devoted to the implementation of Policy gradient algorithms in the context of RL in continuous time with applications to some stochastic models used in finance.
- The second part is devoted to the use of Q-learning algorithms for RL in continuous time.

I will add some plots here.
