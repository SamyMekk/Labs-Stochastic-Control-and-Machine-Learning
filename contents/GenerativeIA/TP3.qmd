All the necessary information is already included in the PDF file. Below is a brief summary of the lab content and some expected results.


## Summary of the lab

<span class="para-title"> Content : </span>

The Lab work is divided into 2 parts : 

- The first part is devoted to the implementation of the SBTS algorithm via the implementation of the optimal drift using kernel methods. Here are some expected plots

- The second part is devoted to the study of the O-U process. You will generate **SBTS** samples of the **O-U** process and estimate the **parameters** of your **SBTS samples** vs the ones of the real O-U process.
  

 We give below some **expected plots** that you should obtain after finishing this part.

## Towards the open ended mini-project


::: {#alg-description .algorithm}

The project for you will be to choose a **time-series dataset** and focus on **data augmentation** using the SBTS algorithm. 
The primary goal is to demonstrate how SBTS-generated samples can help improve model performance on a task of your choice.
You will have freedom to select

- Any time series dataset from any domain
- Find any problem or task where synthetic data can be beneficial. This could include, but not limited to **data augmentation**,
**data imputation**, **scenario simulation** or **stress testing**.
- Anomaly detection
- Any other use case relevant to your interests

Your project should include

- A **clear description** of your chosen dataset and task.
- An **explanation** of how and why you use synthetic data generation.
- Implementation details, including parameters choice for the SBTS method.
- **Model training** and **evaluation protocols**, with comparison when applicable.
- An analysis discussing the impact and benefits of synthetic data in your context.


**Creativity** and **critical analysis** will be important criteria for assessment. Feel free to explore and justify your choices freely
