# Lab work n°3  

You can download the **Lab work n°3** as a PDF file by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMekk/TP-Controle-Stochastique/main/contents/GenerativeIA/PDF-File/Lab3_GenAI_DataGeneration.pdf).


All the necessary information is already included in the PDF file. Below is a brief summary of the lab content and some expected results.


## Summary of the lab 



::: {#alg-description .algorithm}


<span class="para-title"> Content : </span>

The lab work is divided into 2 parts : 

- The first part is devoted to the implementation of the SBTS algorithm via the implementation of the **optimal drift** using **kernel methods**.
  
We give below some expected plots that you should obtain after finishing this part.

- The second part is devoted to the study of the O-U process. You will generate **SBTS** samples of the **O-U** process and estimate the **parameters** of your **SBTS samples** vs the ones of the real O-U process.
  
 We give below some **expected plots** that you should obtain after finishing this part.

## Towards the open ended mini-project


::: {#alg-description .algorithm}

The project for the **GenAI for data generation** can be found at the end the PDF file by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamyMekk/TP-Controle-Stochastique/main/contents/GenerativeIA/PDF-File/Lab3_GenAI_DataGeneration.pdf).

- Please do not forget to indicate your name on the Excel sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H2ZDF7BeY9pMEMaEnG-JyBBCpDcvnkJcoZzA4M7mCMo/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
- Recall that the **submission deadline** for the mini-project and the answers to the lab session^[**No PDF submission** is required for the lab session answers. The answers should be written directly in the **Jupyter notebook** and submitted along with the documents associated with the mini-project.] is set to **31 March 2026**.
