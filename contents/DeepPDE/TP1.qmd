# Lab work n°1  

You can download **Lab Work n°1: Deep PDE Solver** as a Jupyter Notebook [here](TP1-PDE/Lab%20Session%20n%C2%B01%20-%20Deep%20Learning%20for%20PDE.ipynb). All the necessary information is already included in the notebook, but a brief summary of the lab content is provided below for convenience.


## Summary of the lab

<span class="para-title"> Content : </span>

The Lab work is divided into 3 parts : 

- The first part is devoted to get more familiar with the PyTorch library for the ones who are not that familiar with the library.
- The second part is devoted to the implementation of the Deep Galerkin algorithm with so 
- The third part is devoted to the implementation of the Deep BSDE Solver and to 



<span class="para-title"> Main goals : </span>


The TP aims you to implement the various PDE algorithms seen during the class session :

- Get more familiar with the PyTorch library
- Implement the Deep Galerkin and Deep BSDE algorithm and benchmark it with some classic PDE for which we know explicit or semi explicit formulas.

I will add some plots here.
