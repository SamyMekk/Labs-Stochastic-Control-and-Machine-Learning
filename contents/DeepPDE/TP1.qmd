# Lab work n°1  

You can download the **Lab Work n°1: Deep PDE Solver** as a Jupyter Notebook file [here](TP1-PDE/Lab%20Session%20n%C2%B01%20-%20Deep%20Learning%20for%20PDE.ipynb).
^[If you end-up with a **.txt** file, download it and rename it as a **.ipynb** file.] 

All the necessary informations are already included in the **notebook**^[There will be **coding** and **math** questions.].  Below is a brief summary of the lab content and some expected results.


## Summary of the lab

<span class="para-title"> Content : </span>

The Lab work is divided into 2 parts : 

- The first part is devoted to the implementation of the **Deep Galerkin algorithm** where you are going to test it on various PDEs arising in **finance**. We give below some **expected plots** that you should obtain after finishing this part.

- The second part is devoted to the implementation of the **Deep BSDE Solver** where you are going to test it on known PDEs arising from **finance** and **stochastic control problems**. We give below some **expected plots** that you should obtain after finishing this part.

The list of potential projects for the **Deep Learning for PDE** can be found in the PDF file by clicking [here]().

Please do not forget to indicate your name on the Excel sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H2ZDF7BeY9pMEMaEnG-JyBBCpDcvnkJcoZzA4M7mCMo/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and recall that the **submission deadline** for the mini-project and the answers to the lab session^[**No PDF submission** is required for the lab session answers. The answers should be written directly in the **Jupyter notebook** and submitted along with the documents associated with the mini-project.] is set to **31 March 2026**.
