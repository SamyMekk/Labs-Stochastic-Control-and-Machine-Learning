<span class="para-title">Prerequisites :</span>

The **prerequisites** for this course are the following:

- Good knowledge on **Probability Theory** and **Stochastic Processes**.
- Basics on **optimal control theory**.
- Basics on **Deep Learning**.
- Familarity with **Python** and potentially with **PyTorch**.

<span class="para-title">Schedule :</span>

The practical sessions will take place on $\ldots$ each time in **room 15/25 104** at Jussieu and will be divided into three 3-hour sessions, each illustrating the concepts covered during the lecture.

<span class="para-title">Materials :</span>

The practical sessions will be conducted in **Python**. You should bring your own laptop and have your own Python environment set up for each session.

<span class="para-title">Structure of the website :</span>

The site is structured into three sections that make up the course, each consisting of two chapters.

  - <span class="para-subtitle"> Course reminders: </span>

  The first chapter, titled **Course reminders**, presents the key theoretical concepts. 


  - <span class="para-subtitle"> Practical session: </span>

  The second chapter, titled **Lab work** contains the practical session instructions and a link to a **Jupyter notebook file** where you can write your code. te that the Jupyter notebooks files are designed to be **self-sufficient**, allowing you to work independently during the practical sessions.


  - <span class="para-subtitle"> References: </span>

  The site contains a section  **References** 

  - <span class="para-subtitle"> Appendix: </span>

  The site contains also a section **Appendix** where we go more in depth about some topics discussed during the course.
