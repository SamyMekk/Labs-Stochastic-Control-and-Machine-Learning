## Organisation {.unnumbered}

The practical sessions will be divided into three 3-hour sessions, each illustrating the concepts covered during the lecture.


- **Schedule**: The practical sessions will take place on $\ldots$ each time in **room 15/25 104** at Jussieu.

- **Materials**: The practical sessions will be conducted in **Python**. You should bring your own laptop and have your own Python environment set up for each session.
 
- **Planning** : 
  - **Lab work n°1** : About **Deep PDE Solver** for solving partial differential equations.
  - **Lab work n°2** : About **Reinforcement Learning** for stochastic control problems.
  - **Lab work n°3** : About **Generative IA** and **Schrodinger Bridge** for data generation.


- **Grade** : $\ldots$ To be confirmed


## Use this website {.unnumbered}

The site is structured into three sections that make up the course, each consisting of two chapters. The first chapter, titled **Course reminders**, presents the key theoretical concepts, followed by the second chapter, which contains the practical session instructions and a link to a **Jupyter notebook file** where you can write your code.

Note that the Jupyter notebooks files are designed to be **self-sufficient**, allowing you to work independently during the practical sessions.

For your information, this site is generated using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), and the notes are available on this [GitHub](https://github.com/SamyMekk/TP-Controle-Stochastique) page. If you spot any errors on the site, feel free to report them through pull requests.
