## Organisation {.unnumbered}

The practical sessions will be divided into three 3-hour sessions, each illustrating the concepts covered during the lecture.


- **Schedule**: The practical sessions will take place on $\ldots$ each time in **room 15/25 104** at Jussieu.

- **Materials**: The practical sessions will be conducted in **Python**. You should bring your own laptop and have your own Python environment set up for each session.
 
- **Planning** : 
  - **Lab work n°1** : About **Deep PDE Solver** for solving partial differential equations.
  - **Lab work n°2** : About **Reinforcement Learning** for stochastic control problems.
  - **Lab work n°3** : About **Generative IA** and **Schrodinger Bridge** for data generation.


- **Grade** : $\ldots$ To be confirmed


## Use this website {.unnumbered}

The site is structured into three sections that make up the course, each consisting of two chapters. The first chapter, titled **Course reminders**, presents the key theoretical concepts, followed by the second chapter, which contains the practical session instructions and a link to a **Jupyter notebook file** where you can write your code.

Note that the Jupyter notebooks files are designed to be **self-sufficient**, allowing you to work independently during the practical sessions.

For your information, this site is generated using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), and the notes are available on this [GitHub](https://github.com/SamyMekk/TP-Controle-Stochastique) page. If you spot any errors on the site, feel free to report them through pull requests.

## Instructors {.unnumbered}

The Lab sessions for this course have been prepared by [Samy](https://samymekk.github.io/) and [Alexandre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-alouadi/). We want to thank [Huyên Pham](https://sites.google.com/site/phamxuanhuyen/) for beeing our advisor and for the confidence in letting us preparing the lab works of his course.

The **prerequisites** for this course are the following:

- Good knowledge on **Probability Theory** and **Stochastic Processes**.
- Basics on **optimal control theory**.
- Basics on **Deep Learning**.
- Familarity with **Python** and potentially with **PyTorch**.





If you have any  **questions**, you can either e-mail [Samy](mailto:samy.mekkaoui@polytechnique.edu) or [Alexandre](mailto:alexandre.alouadi@polytechnique.edu).
